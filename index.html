                        Food deserts plague many neighborhoods and housing blocks across the United States. Supermarkets offering fresh food options move out of low-income neighborhoods into high-income ones. The food gap left by their repositioning is filled by fast food options, which seek to offer nutritionally poor, low-quality, food options. Naturally, members of these neighborhoods who have little time and money to buy ingredients and cook, are incentivized to purchase these unhealthy options, perpetuating chronic health conditions and a toxic food culture within these areas.

                    OBESITY HAS GROWN STEADILY SINCE THE LATE 90S AND HAS ONLY SEEN MORE GROWTH SINCE THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES' OBESITY CRISIS, BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES IS THE RELATIONSHIPS WE SHARE WITH OUR FOOD AND MEALTIME. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WE PUT EMPHASIS ON THE QUANTITY OF FOOD AND NOT ITS QUALITY. WE TAKE VERY LITTLE TIME TO EAT OUR MEALS. OUR FOOD CULUTURE HAS PUT EMPHASIS ON THE PURE MASS SUBSTANCE EATEN RATHER THAN THE APPRECIATION OF WHAT WE EAT AND THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY PART OF THE PROBLEM. WE MUST BEGIN TO REVERSE THESE TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS. IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE LEARN HOW TO ENJOY OUR FOOD BY HAVING A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH IT. MAINTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND REDEFINING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD IS THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE OUR OBESITY CRISIS.
